Repository
A repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.

Advantages of repository pattern

- Minimizes duplicate query logic
- Decouples application from  persistance framework
- All Databases queries are centralized and not scattered throughout the app.
- Allows us to change ORM easily
- Promotes testability
We can easily Mock a Repository interface, testing against the DbContext is more difficult

Desavantages of respository pattern
- Abstraction of an abstraction
- Each root entity should have it's own repository which means more code
Also need to implement the UnitOfWork pattern to control transactions
